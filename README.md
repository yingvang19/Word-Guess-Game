# Word-Guess-Game
#What is this repository or project? 
I have created this guess game for a homework assignment for my Coding Boot Camp.
The theme I have chosen was the movies in the 80â€™s.
The language to setup the project are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

#How does it work?
Press any alphabetic key to start the game.
If you win or lose a sound will play, it will display a picture.
Have fun and enjoy the game.
